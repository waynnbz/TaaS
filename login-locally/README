1. Run any static files server inside this directory, for example:
   - `npx http-server . -p 5000`
   - `php -S localhost:5000`
2. Run your application on http://localhost:3000.
3. Now you can open http://localhost:5000 in browser and click login (wait it a little bit, it may take time to redirect you). After you login, you should be redirected back to http://localhost:3000
